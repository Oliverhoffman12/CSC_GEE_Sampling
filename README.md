# CSC_GEE_Sampling
The goal of this Google Earth Engine JavaScript is to create a data driven soil sampling scheme for specific field. This specific code is geared towards soil carbon, but can easily be adapted and applied for other purposes as well. 
Data: POLARIS- Organic Matter, Bulk Density, Clay Percentage, Residual Soil Moisture, and Hydraulic Conductivity. Sentinel-2- Normalized Differnce Water Index and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Terrain: Slope Map (ESRI).  
Note: The idea for this project was based upon the Stratifi v3.2 Earth Engine App Created by Skidmore College but altered to fit specific critera of another project at Colorado State University.
